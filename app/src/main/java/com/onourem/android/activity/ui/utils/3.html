<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So here's what this Privacy Policy is all about.<span
        class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We at Onourem are a community driven to make this world a happier and a better place. We do this through Onourem Social Games by building deeper connections via refreshing conversations. To provide our services and make them better, we learn some things about you when you use our App. For example, if we know how you are feeling, we try and make you feel better by small pep-talk-kinda messages. Or, when you want to share a memory, we feel that it would be great to share it through the picture that it is captured in. Or, we let you connect to your friends by seeing who in your contact list is already on Onourem.</span>
</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>But how do we collect this information?</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><span class="s1">First, we learn from whatever information you choose to give us. For example, when you set up an Onourem account, we learn your birthday, email address, and the unique name you'd like to go by. Or everyday when you first interact with us, it's heart-welling to know how you are feeling.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Second, we sometimes learn about you from other people and services. For example, if a friend uploads their contact list, we might see your phone number.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Third, we learn about you when you use our service through user analytics. For example, if you spend time on question games, it's safe to assume that you'd like to be informed about them.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>How we share information?</b></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">When we share information, it's usually because you ask us to \u2014 like when you want to play a question game with Public or defined privacy settings. Some of your information, like your username and anything with public visibility settings, is visible to the public by default.</span>
</p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">We also share information within the Group or our business partners that help us provide our services, and when we think it's required by law.</span>
</p>
<p class="p13"><span
        class="s1">But for most everything else, we maintain that you are in control.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>How we Store Information?</b></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">Any content that you post is stored with us for as long as you want us to store that subject to our fundamental guidelines for uploading content related to our specific features. Some other information may be stored for longer. For example, you may create a question on Onourem and send it to your friends. When you delete your account, this question may stay in the system. We store your basic account information until you ask us to delete it. And we're constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with better content.</span>

<p class="p12"><span class="s1">Want to update your account information or change who can see what content that you post on the app?
